## Open Scientist, Technology Instructor, Filmmaker

Oh hai! I didn't see you there. Welcome to my world wide webs internet site! Would you like a sandwich? Perhaps, a cup of tea?

####No?

*You just want information?*

####Got it.

*You just want me in a nutshell?*

Aside from being great at taking things literally, I am **clearly** a *"master"* of photoshop. I also make videos, webinars and tutorials!

I like to make things in the *real* world too! I've never met a power tool I don't like, except for nail guns...we've had some problems.

I like to do physical things like most physical beings. You **can't** catch me on my bike, but you can try. You **can** catch me doing yoga (super unique, I know), backpacking in nature, swimming, poorly surfing or scuba-diving in the ocean. I've also made some appearances on my beloved Honda Ruckus, no it's not a motorcycle. Yes, I know that's sad. Doesn't change the fact that I love the silly thing!

Anyway, I guess that's **see above image.**
