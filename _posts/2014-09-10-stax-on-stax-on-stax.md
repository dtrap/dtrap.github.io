**I am so excited to announce that I accepted an offer from** [DataStax](http://datastax.com) **as Curriculum Developer.**

This marks a new era for me, as my previous working experience has come mostly from academia.
I have been nothing short of impressed with DataStax thus far, and it's only just beginning!
The people working there are professional and passionate about what they do.

DataStax is shifting the database paradigm to new approaches, and the effects are incredible.
The radically scalable, always-on architecture has led to successes cross-industry that are truly fascinating.
Netflix provides one, often-cited, example of Apache Cassandra's far-reaching utility.
Serving media and in so doing, compiling the collected meta-data for future Netflix-original production is smart, but it's also revolutionary.
It's artful in a way that balances the technical with the creative, and that's just one success story!

I am specifically excited about this work because I love writing readable material that reduces barrier to entry.
This is often an issue in highly technical architectures, and I hope to make the start-up process more accessible.
I am both humbled and elated to be joining this wonderful team!

**Hello DataStax!**
