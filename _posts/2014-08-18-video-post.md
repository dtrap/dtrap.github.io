**Open science** is a cause I got behind a while back. While I am far from an open science hipster, nor do I hold a particular claim to OG status like my good friends at [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org/), this is a big deal. & I've hopped on board, 100%.

## UCSF

My interest in open science began as a product of my tissue engineering internship at UCSF (2013-2014) courtesy of the [California Institute for Regenerative Medicine.](http://www.cirm.ca.gov/) During my time there, I studied cartilage tissue engineering with the goal of surgical and stem cell applications. I worked under the great advisement of [Shuvo Roy, PhD](http://pharm.ucsf.edu/roy/people) and [Jeffrey Lotz, PhD.](http://orthosurg.ucsf.edu/home/faculty/biography/jeffrey-lotz-phd/)
Working at two different UCSF campuses and utilizing [electrospinning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrospinning) machinery from [Song Li's](http://ctelab.berkeley.edu/) lab in Berkeley gave me both commuting and collaboration chops.

I also worked with a lot of diverse equipment which generated image, CAD files and everything in between. I look back on those flash-drive dependent times with a heavy heart. My science had become more about sorting the meta-data than doing the work. I had elaborate notes on what files were from which experiments. **SEM_image_14_1_07_14: Experiment dated January 16th, 2014: Results...etc.** If only my files could talk, my work would have been a lot less confused within the interspace of the analog and digital realms.

Yeah, matters were pretty bad then, and they were about to get worse. My house was broken into, and my laptop stolen. Many sadfaces were had that day. Luckily, I had backed up almost all of my data, but so began the sorting nightmare, round 2.

If only there were some way to keep track of these files, with all the cursed versions of them. If only each modification could have an attached note stored somewhere in the cloud! I tried my best to create an organized google docs oasis, but it was such grief to manage! I wanted to be able to give out a link the two conferences I presented my poster at that described my work. I wanted to have a place to collaborate with my colleagues besides a fury of emails. I wanted others to be able to build off of my work in the lab when I left, especially after seeing so many written dead (lab notebook) soldiers scattered here and there. Don't get me wrong this has worked for centuries, but I think an upgrade is long overdue.

## UC Berkeley, D-lab and Software Carpentry

Little did I know that upgrades were headed my way, thanks to the *amazing people* at [UC Berkeley's D-lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/) and [Software Carpentry.](http://software-carpentry.org/) I started working again at UC Berkeley in a different division of the same department I had worked in during my undergraduate studies. This began right as my UCSF internship was ending. As luck would have it, this is when I would begin to learn about all the amazing tools that are available for programmers to back-up, version, share and collaborate on their code. These tools, and the way programmers work together isn't an island only they live on or can benefit from. We all stand to gain from the open-source share culture that has been brewing for the past few decades. It was then I first read my friend [Karthik Ram's](http://nature.berkeley.edu/~kram/) of rOpenSci's [paper](http://www.scfbm.org/content/8/1/7) on reproducible and collaborative data science.

That's when I jumped in full-tilt to learning data science through the D-lab, Software Carpentry and teaching this course:

I directed the above video for the 1st annual [BIDS](http://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/datascience) fair, with my friend and colleague [Kristina Kangas](http://scholar.berkeley.edu/kristinakangas/). That's where I met [Arfon Smith](http://www.arfon.org/), who has since come out to other events at UC Berkeley and helped out with the rOpenSci hackathon in April 2014, writing the following post about our adventures there.

## rOpenSci and GitHub for Science and more teaching!

I helped organize the hackathon with Karthik and the folks of rOpenSci and directed the video you see below for GitHub working with another GitHubber, [Peter Furia](https://github.com/blog/1417-peter-furia-is-a-githubber) and filmmaker Kevin Jones.

From here, I started getting more involved with using GitHub and teaching it to beginners. I taught a webinar on using GitHub pages, which is what my site is served with using [mmistakes' theme.](https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme)

I hope this finds someone out there buried in a tomb of data and shines in some light. If I can help by shining in any more, you can contact me here and I'll do my best. Nothing brings me greater joy.

## Reflections and Thanks

Speaking of which, this past year I realized, I've *grown* a lot by:

* Introducing people to technology they'd otherwise be unlikely to use
* Evangelizing the active, revolutionary world of Open Science
* Acquiring git/GitHub, python and other software skills
* Teaching women and scientists computing methods with Software Carpentry
* Learning from my own learning & simplifying technical topics
* Meeting loads of new friends along the way

It's been a *blast!*

Many thanks to the people who have helped me grow or guided me along the way. You made all the *difference* in my world! <3
